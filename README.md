# Welcome to My Square
***

## Task
I am to create a program which displays a beautiful square using C language

## Description
I created a function int main which has two parameters ac which is argument count and av which is argument value, i created  a variable x and y and initialised them both to 0.
i have an if condition which says if ac == 2 then y=0 else if ac ==3 then i used the atoi function to turn a number string to an integer, which is x =atoi(av[1]) then y=atoi(av[2]).
next i used a nested for loop the inner loop, loops through y with the iterator i, and the inner loop loops through x with the iterator j, inside the inner loop function i used a nested if statement, the outer if says if i==0 OR i==y-1, and the inner loop say if j==0 OR j==x-1 it should print "o",
then i added an else statementfor the inner if statement which is else print "-", for the outer if statementi added an else statement which is else then an if and else statement in the else block code, the if statement say if j==0 OR j==x-1 print "|" else print " "(space).
At the end of the inner for loop i said it should print null terminator "\n". 

## Installation
i have nothing to install to this program

## Usage
i have no usage for this program
